            <p>As the co-founder and CEO of Drypp, I am dedicated to the start-up almost full-time alongside my team. We have been actively involved in shaping our innovative hydration solutions and are excited to announce that we are about to launch our products. My role has centered on product development, managing the design process for our smart hydration solution and accompanying platform. I’ve worked closely with a small, dedicated team to integrate innovative features and ensure that the product meets the needs of athletes and trainers. 

                Additionally, I’ve helped develop strategic partnerships and played a key role in our user acquisition efforts, particularly within the collegiate sports and bottle manufacture markets. By contributing to both the technical and operational aspects of the company, I’ve been able to help Drypp grow steadily while maintaining a focus on our core mission of improving hydration management, especially in sports.

            <p>I spearheaded, with my team, an innovative initiative that would take place in the Gulf of Mexico aimed at combining renewable energy production with marine conservation. Leveraging solar, hydraulic, and eolic energy, Coral Spark would transform abandoned oil rigs into platforms for both generating electricity and fostering coral reef growth. It was designed and implemented as a dual-purpose system that uses electrified reef technology to enhance coral resilience while producing renewable energy. All in all, we developed a sustainable revenue model by storing excess energy in batteries for commercialization and on-shore supply, demonstrating a commitment to environmental sustainability and innovative solutions to address climate change.

            <p>In the summer of 2024, I interned with <a href="https://fater.ai/en/" target="_blank">Fater AI</a>, a software company developing a machine-aided-design software. They generate intricate 3D CAD models from natural language to gain efficiency and time. As a machine learning intern, I worked on 3D animated scripts to represent diverse architectural figures, such as the Kisefos Museum.</p>

            <p>In my second robotics project, undertaken in a Foundations of Engineering lab, I had the exciting opportunity to create a line-following robot that bore a striking resemblance to Wall-E. This project was a perfect blend of software and hardware work, requiring a comprehensive understanding of both disciplines. Leveraging Arduino materials, my team and I delved into the world of C++ programming to code the intricate functionalities of the robot. The task involved not only manipulating physical components but also implementing complex algorithms to enable the robot to autonomously follow a designated path. The end result was a harmonious integration of engineering principles and coding prowess, culminating in a charming robot capable of navigating its surroundings with precision.</p>

            <img src="img/Restau1.JPG" style="width: 100%;">
            <p>During my senior year of high school, I participated in the CanYouWeb competition, where I embarked on my first humble professional project. The challenge was to create websites for a restaurant and a coffee shop, utilizing my basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Java. Eager to apply what I had learned in my coding journey, I crafted visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces for both the restaurant and coffee shop. Incorporating my understanding of HTML for structuring, CSS for styling, and Java for interactive elements, with my partner, we successfully developed functional websites that showcased my budding skills. This project not only marked a significant milestone in my coding endeavors but also ignited my passion for web development. Feel free to take a look at the Restaurant website and the Coffeeshop website</p>

            <img src="img/todo.jpeg" style="width: 350px;height:500px;margin-left:320px;">
            <p>After acquiring the fundamental skills in app development through a workshop with a school organization, I embarked on my first comprehensive app development project. The inspiration behind this endeavor stemmed from observing one of my closest friends, Tatiana, struggling with productivity. Leveraging my newfound knowledge in React.js, I decided to create a personalized app tailored to address Tatiana's organizational challenges. The app not only served as a practical tool for task management but also incorporated elements of gamification to make the process more engaging and motivating for her. This project not only honed my development skills but also showcased the transformative power of technology in addressing real-life challenges among friends.</p>
