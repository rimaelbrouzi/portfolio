                        <p>As a student manager for the USF Men's Soccer Team, I played a crucial role in ensuring the smooth operation of the team both on and off the field. My responsibilities included managing equipment, coordinating team logistics, and assisting with game-day preparations. I worked closely with the coaching staff to support their strategic and administrative needs, helping to organize practices, travel arrangements, and other essential aspects of team management. Additionally, I served as a point of contact for players, addressing their needs and ensuring they had everything required for optimal performance. My role also involved data collection and analysis to support coaching decisions and improve team strategies. Through this experience, I gained valuable skills in organization, communication, and teamwork, all of which contributed to the overall success of the team. I have been occupying this role for over 3 years now, I absolutely love it!</p>

                        <p>As Vice President of the Collegiate Entrepreneurs’ Organization (CEO) at USF, I took on a pivotal role in reshaping the club's logistics and operations to enhance its effectiveness and impact. I spearheaded the restructuring of our internal processes, ensuring that our activities and initiatives were streamlined and efficiently managed. One of my key contributions was organizing a series of entrepreneurship events and workshops that provided valuable learning and networking opportunities for our members. These efforts led to a remarkable 45% increase in member engagement, reflecting the success of our revitalized approach. My role involved not only strategic planning and execution but also fostering a dynamic environment that encouraged active participation and growth among student entrepreneurs.</p>

                        <p>As a Student Researcher at the AMHR Lab, I focused on identifying cognitive traits using advanced large language models. My research centered around the Chain Free Association Task, where I explored how individuals’ next-word predictions could reveal underlying cognitive patterns and differences. I was responsible for analyzing extensive datasets, developing Python modules to fine-tune models for enhanced accuracy, and contributing to the understanding of language processing in relation to cognition. I collaborated with senior researchers, leveraged cutting-edge AI technologies, and played a pivotal role in advancing the lab’s goal of using language models to bridge the gap between AI and human cognitive research. My work directly impacted the lab's ability to make significant strides in understanding individual cognitive differences and their relationship with language prediction tasks.</p>
